As of late I have started to figure out ways to carry a lot of little useful items on me.  Having tried a little notebook, (insert size here) and not finding it big enough to write on, I started to experiment with a slightly larger notebook that can fit in the back of my pocket.  I tested this out with an old notebook I had and really like the size format, just not the graph paper that it came with.  I unfortunately lost it while at PyCon this year at the Indians game.  I have had my eye on the [Field Notes](fieldnotes.com) version and decided to bit the bullet and purchase one.

I decided to go with the dot graph version as the graph paper was too cluttered, but I wanted to try something different than your normal lined paper.


Some modifiations had to be done to handle the weather in South Carolina where it is hot and humid through a large portion of the year.  The biggest issue is the binding breaking down faster than you can use up the notebook due to sweat :|.  I found an easy fix on the Every Day Carry Subreddit, which is to wrap the binding (THis is not the right word) in clear plastic tape.  I tried this out with the notebook I lost and it worked perfectly.  I have the basic steps below to show how I did it to get the best coverage of the notebook.
