Title: ModuleNotFoundError No module named phd
Date: 2018-07-15 00:00


Ok, after almost 5 years working and developing Python Codes. Its
time to go for a PhD.  This shouldn't be too hard, right?

	:::python
    >>> import phd
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'phd'
    >>> 

Wait....

Ergh.  I can't just keep importing things..

So, you've somehow wandered over to
this blog and I would like to personally welcome you here.  This is going to be
a documentation of my journey towards a PhD while also working a full time job. 

So who am I? My name is Andrew Kail and I graduated from the University of Tennessee in 2011 and 2013 with a Bachelor and Masters degree
in Aerospace Engineering.  Currently I'm a Full Stack Engineer at Savannah River National 
Laboratory in South Carolina where I work in a computing group and am mostly
"The Python Guy".

I'm starting a PhD after having worked at a National Lab for
5 years.  Why?  I ask myself that same question everytime I think about the start
of classes in a few weeks.  Its been on my mind for a while now and was a little bit when I was finishing
up my Masters.  At the time I was definitely not ready to continue my education from a maturity
and work ethic standpoint, and thankfully my advisor made sure I knew that. I also had no idea what
degree I would like to pursue or what I was even doing with my career really.  I was an Aerospace Engineer who
realized he was far more interested in programming and computing than building rockets and planes for NASA or SpaceX (I have
to admit, that recent [SpaceX Launhc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbSwFU6tY1c) was pretty amazing). Given a few years
and self reflection, I started to consider the idea more and more, especially when I realized I could get it payed for by
work.  I had a few roadblocks though. I liked my job, couldn't find a program nearby in semi-rural South Carolina, and I just
didn't like the idea of doing a Computer Science PhD as that was all that I could find.

Things took a turn in December when I discovered the [Information Science](https://ualr.edu/online/programs/cis/) program 
at the University of Arkansas Little Rock.  It piqued my interest. It covered a lot of the topics I was interested in
such as data science, machine learning, information system architecture and visualization. It also allows me to work remotely
and the courses are held at reasonable hours so I could continue to work full time.
I was accepted into the program about a month ago and have been working to get everything taken care of.

So, why the blog? I'll cover the why in more detail in another post so come back for more! As for what you can expect,
here are some of the things I will be trying to write about: 

* Overall Progress
* Fun content to keep my spirits up
* Useful links
* Reading Recommendations
* Hopefully links and announcements on publications
* and General updates and frustrations

If you read this and stick around I really appreciate and I hope we all can get something out of this.

~ Andrew
