## [Hauberk](https://hauberk.readthedocs.io)

An email automation framework.  Currently in Alpha status.

## [HPC Administrators Handbook](https://hpc.kail.io)

A major work in progress, this handbook is a pipe dream of mine to adapt
the [Linux Administrators Handbook](https://www.informit.com/store/unix-and-linux-system-administration-handbook-9780134277554) to HPC Operations.  As I work on this blog
and continue to manage an HPC team at DST I hope to fill out this book for both
internal training and my personal skill development.

## [Document Scanning Automation](https://github.com/akail/scanner)

A simple tool to help with reading in multiple documents on a cheap
flatbed scanner, apply OCR and merge the pages.
