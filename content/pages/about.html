                    Hi, my name is Andrew Kail and I am a full-stack engineer and Python developer in Aiken, South Carolina.  I'm originally from
                    Tennessee where I went to school at the University of Tennessee Knoxville where I received my Masters in
                    Aerospace Engineering.
                <p>

                <p>
                    I have started this blog as a way for me to explore the software stacks behind our favorite websites and applications.
                    I love to tinker with various applications and this is just an extension of that.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Most of the posts here should be tutorial like in nature and I will try to keep them update to date as best as I
                    possibly can. The blog software itself has been written by me in Python and I plan on testing some of the tools and
                    workflows on this app.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Thank you for stopping by and reading my blog and I hope you learn something new while you're here.
                </p>
