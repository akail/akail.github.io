I'm a Chief Technology Officer, HPC Engineer, and PhD Candidate at [Data in Science Technologies](https://datainscience.com/), where I
manage a highly experienced team of HPC Compute and Storage engineers.

I started my journey in High Performance Computing while completing
my Masters Degree in Aerospace Engineering at the University of
Tennessee Knoxville.  There, I started developing massively parallelized
Finite-Element analysis software for loosely-coupled physics solutions, running
this software on the now decommisioned supercomputer [Kraken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken_(supercomputer)).

After graduating I decided to pursue a career in HPC and landed in the
scientific computing group at [Savannah River National Laboratory](https://srnl.doe.gov/). I then spent the next 6 years at SRNL becoming
familiar with many aspects of the HPC stack, developed experience in
developing Python software.  By the time I left in the summer
of 2020, I was the Scientific Applications Development lead and started a PhD program
in Computer and Information Science at University of Arkansas Little Rock.

6 months after coming to DST I stepped in as the interim Engineering Director, anshortly afterwards became the CTO and
Engineer Manager at DST.  My goals have been to streamline our HPC operations with proper documentation, configuration
management, automations, monitoring, and security best practices to produce leadership compute facility
services at scale.

I have started this blog in an attempt to document many of the intricate work being done in HPC and machine learning I
have done over the years.
