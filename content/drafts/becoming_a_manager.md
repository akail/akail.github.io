At the beginning of 2021 I was asked to step in as the Engineering Manager
at DST.  I was excited at the prospect and the impact I could have at such a small
company

### The Manager's Path

The book that really helped me become a manager.

### High Output Management

For several books on this list, this is their main point of inspiration.  What Andy Grove did

This book was heavily referenced in "The Manager's Path" and "Measure What Matter'", and quite
honestly underpins several other books including "The Phoenix Project" and "First, Break All The Rules".

### The Phoenix Project

This book is both fun and infuriating for me to read and as such can not recommend reading it right before bed time.
I do however love the story and can relate to many of the issues the protagonists experience throughout the book.  I like to read it once every year or so to get me thinking about how we handle operations at work.

### Unwritten Laws of Engineering


## Future Reads

A few books I have in the pipe to read.

* The Evaluation Interview
* Emotional Intelligence 2.0
