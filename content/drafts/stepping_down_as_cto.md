This is a hard post to write as I try to stop and
think about the decision I have made.

In early 2021 I was asked to step in as the interim engineering manager at 
my company, eventually taking over the position permanently.  While the title
changed to CTO, the role didn't.  I still participated as an individual contributor
much of the time, but was also dedicated to management, project management, and technical
leadership.

While I feel I still have much to contribute the time has come for me to step down from
my managerial role and focus on my technical skills and leadership.

This was not an easy decision to make as I am truly worried about the long term future
of my company, but there were several long running things that have led me to this decision.
