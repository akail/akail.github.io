I've seen alacritty pop up a lot lately and wanted to give it a try.

Decided to make a plunge on my laptop as my daily terminal driver over Konsole.

Setup tmux to start automaticallya. 
Decided possibly against doing this as I use tmuxp to load different preset configurrations for different things.

Pro's
* Text driven configuration
  This was actually a big thing for me as I am trying to drive so much of my
  configuration to ansible when I can.  One of those frustrating things to configure
  has been my KDE environment.  I like a particular gruvbox colorscheme.  While its quick and easy to just set it once
  and move on with my life.  But if I can at least do it with my terminal

Con's
* Doesn't have scrolling - needs tmux
* If I get tmux going, then it will
